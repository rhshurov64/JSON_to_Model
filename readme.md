Previously i was familier with CRUD operation but not do any CRUD operation with JSON file.
By this project, I have learned-
# Work with JSON data wand save it to model by export_import
# Learned something new for drwaing chart that is chart.js 
# how to pass dynamic data from model for bar and line chart
# how to set dynamic data for x & y axis
